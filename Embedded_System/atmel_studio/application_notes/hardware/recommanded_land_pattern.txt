Question	
Do you have any PCB footprints/Land patterns recommendation available?


Answer	
We do unfortunately not supply CAD symbols/PCB footprints. All AVR devices use a standard industry package (JEDEC). The formal reference to the standard is available in the respective datasheet under the 'Packaging Information' chapter.

There are footprints available made by third party vendors. For example, you can use the link: IPC Land Pattern Calculator for calculating land patterns using the IPC-7351A Land Pattern Calculator.
It allows users to view IPC approved land pattern dimensional data in tabular form as well as graphical images that illustrate how a component is attached to the land pattern on the board.

You can also find OrCAD and Protel99SE AVR Library on avrfreaks at this link: Footprints. The standard industry footprints are usually distributed with layout tools such as Orcad, Altium, Eagle, etc. 

Please note that these are not made by Atmel; hence they will not be supported by us.
